This practical provided hands-on experience with stochastic SIR modeling, a valuable tool in epidemiology.
SIR Model:
Through the application of random function, I successfully simulated an SIR Model to simulate the most simplified version of epidemic spread.

Vaccination Model:
Adding a vaccination factor was interesting. I observed how varying vaccination percentages impacted the infection curve, providing a tangible example of herd immunity.

2D Spatial Model:
Transitioning to a 2D model added complexity. I learned about spatial effects, like local infection clusters, which the basic SIR model doesn't capture.

The most challenge I met is to correctly show the plot of 2D spatial model because I didn't know how to show a series of plots in 1 file code.
